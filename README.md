Hello, my name is **Anuj Kumar** and I am currently a student at **SF State University** completing a bachelor's degree in **Computer Science**. I am looking for an **entry-level job** or an **internship** as a **Software Engineer**.

### School and Personal Projects

Below are some of the repositories for my school and personal projects:

- **CSC415**: I collaborated with my classmates to create our own filesystem in this repository as well as all assigned homework. It allows a user to:
  - Create and delete directories and files
  - Use basic terminal commands such as `ls`, `ls -l`, `cwd`, `cd`, etc.

- **CSC413**: This repository contains my classwork and a project where I worked with my classmates to create a **Banking App**. The app allows users to:
  - Create and login an account with password hashing for security. 
  - Withdraw, deposit, and transfer money

  This project uses:
  - **MongoDB**
  - **React**
  - **Java** for all endpoints
